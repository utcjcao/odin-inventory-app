# odin-inventory-app

a pokemon move database where you can see pokemon and pokemon move relationships. Made with express and sql

things I learned: postgresql, express, ejs

things I struggled with: routing crud requests and input validation.

things I'm proud of: you can search up pokemon, see their moves, click on any move, and see what pokemon also have that move
